    <h2 className="subheading">AI Chat Interface</h2>
    <p className="indented-paragraph">
      The `AI Chat Interface` allows users to interact with an AI model by providing a prompt and receiving a response. This feature integrates a backend API that generates AI responses based on the input provided by the user. The form allows users to enter a prompt, submit it to the backend, and view the AI's generated response.
    </p>

    <h3 className="subheading">Input Section</h3>
    <p className="indented-paragraph">
      The input section of the AI Chat form allows the user to enter a textual prompt that will be sent to the backend API for processing. The prompt can be anything, such as a question, instruction, or any other text-based input for the AI model to generate a response.
    </p>

    <h3 className="subheading">Response Section</h3>
    <p className="indented-paragraph">
      Once the user submits the prompt, the system sends the input to the backend API, which processes the input and generates a response. The AI response is then displayed in the response section of the form, allowing the user to view the generated output. This feature allows users to interact with the AI and receive meaningful text responses.
    </p>

    <h3 className="subheading">Authentication & Access</h3>
    <p className="indented-paragraph">
      The AI Chat interface requires authentication to ensure that the user is authorized to interact with the system. A token-based authentication system is used, with the userâ€™s token being sent along with the request headers. If the user does not have the appropriate access or the token is missing, they will not be able to interact with the AI service.
    </p>

    <h3 className="subheading">Loading & Error Handling</h3>
    <p className="indented-paragraph">
      While the request is being processed, the system displays a loading message to inform the user that the AI model is generating a response. If an error occurs while fetching the response, an error message will be displayed, allowing the user to understand what went wrong.
    </p>

    <h3 className="subheading">Purpose</h3>
    <p className="indented-paragraph">
      The primary purpose of the AI Chat form is to provide a simple and intuitive interface for interacting with an AI model. It facilitates easy communication with the backend AI services and provides users with AI-generated responses for various inputs, which could be used for tasks like question answering, creative writing, problem solving, and more.
